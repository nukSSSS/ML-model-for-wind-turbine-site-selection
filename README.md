# ML-model-for-wind-turbine-site-selection
This script allows you to predict the potential of selected coordinate points on the map as sites for the construction of new wind turbines. To run the model, you need two data sets. 

The first should contain data on existing turbines in your area of interest, as well as random points to balance the model. The second set should contain points that you consider potential sites for the construction of new wind turbines. These can be manually selected locations or a cloud of points in the selected area.
